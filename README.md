# Template for a static web app based on HTML, CSS & TypeScript

The goal of this project is to have a very simple way to get started building static websites. I want to rely on as little dependencies as possible, while still providing a good developer experience. 

This project contains the bare minimum to get started, the features are:

* Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Live debugging
* VS Code support

## Getting Started

In order to get started with this template, ensure `npm` is installed on your machine.

When running in VS Code, the template supports JavaScript Debugging.

Then:

```sh
$ npm install # install dependencies - only needed first time
$ npm run dev # edit files & get live updates!
```
